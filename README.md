RThe Booking.com Review Scraper is a Python script designed to fetch reviews from Booking.com by making HTTP requests with provided cookies and headers. It utilizes the `requests` library to fetch the page content and `lxml` for parsing the HTML response using XPath. The script extracts various review details such as reviewer name, country, room type, stay duration, stay date, traveller type, and review title. Users can adjust parameters like the total number of reviews and batch size to customize the scraping process. After setting up the required cookies and headers, users can run the script to fetch reviews from the specified Booking.com page. The extracted data can then be used for analysis or further processing as needed.
